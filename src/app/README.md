Project Overview

Async Race is a single-page application (SPA) for managing a collection of cars, operating their engines, and showcasing race statistics.
It allows users to:

Create, edit, and delete cars with name and color.

Start and stop car engines individually or as a race.

Track winners and race statistics.

Navigate between Garage and Winners views with preserved input states.

The UI is fully responsive and animated, supporting screens as small as 500px.

Notes on Task Timeline

According to the official task description, the development timeline was stated as 3 weeks, while the email communication mentioned 2 weeks.
As a result, I prioritized implementing core functionality within the provided timeframe. This is why some non-essential features, such as pagination for the garage and sorting in the winners table, beautiful UI were not fully completed.
